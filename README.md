# Patels-to-the-Metals-Classification
[Petals to the Metal - Flower Classification on TPU](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started/overview) is the first competition that I participated on Kaggle.  It is a "Getting Started with TPUs on Kaggle" code competition.  I really learned a lot from the free courses, published notebooks by Kaggle stuffs and others.  The competition Rules page starts with this: "This is a fun competition aimed at helping you get started with using TPUs in machine learning."  I won't say that it is fun, but I really enjoyed it.  I definitely will do more competitions. I joined all the communities and joined in some discussions.  The Kaggle communities are friendly and helpful.  If Kaggle is new to you, please join in.  You will be glad that you did.

## Overview  
TPUs are powerful hardware accelerators specialized in deep learning tasks. They were developed (and first used) by Google to process large image databases, such as extracting all the text from Street View. This competition is designed for you to give TPUs a try.

TPU quotas are available on Kaggle at no cost to users.

## Data Description  
In this Getting Started competition ([what is a Getting Started competition?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started/overview/faq)), we're classifying 104 types of flowers based on their images drawn from five different public datasets. Some classes are very narrow, containing only a particular sub-type of flower (e.g. pink primroses) while other classes contain many sub-types (e.g. wild roses).

The dataset contains imperfections - images of flowers in odd places, or as a backdrop to modern machinery - but that's part of the challenge! Build a classifier that can see past all that, to the flowers at the heart of the images.   

## Rules 
You must accept the [rules for the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started/rules) before you may start.

## Submitted Notebook
Here is the notebook i submitted to the code competition:  [Petals-to-the-Metal-Flower-Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/saukha/petals-to-the-metal-flower-classification). My notebook received upvotes from kaggle monitoring stuffs and fellow kagglers as I was fine-tuning my training model. That brought me my first silce medel on notebooks and gave me so much support and encouragement. It is truly a enriching experience to me!
